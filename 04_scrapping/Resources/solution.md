# 04_scrapping

## Instructions to reproduce

Script for scrapping every url from .hidden found in robots.txt : âžœ  Works python3 main.py

`http://192.168.64.13/.hidden/whtccjokayshttvxycsvykxcfm/igeemtxnvexvxezqwntmzjltkt/lmpanswobhwcozdqixbowvbrhw/README`

## How to prevent

Implement rate limiting and rate throttling mechanisms to restrict the number of requests a single IP address can make in a given time period.
This prevents automated scrapers from flooding your server with requests.
You can also use Captcha to prevent automated scrapers from accessing your website.
